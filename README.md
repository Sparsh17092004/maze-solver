A C++ project that implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms to solve mazes efficiently using object-oriented design principles and the Standard Template Library (STL).

## 🎯 Features

- **Two Pathfinding Algorithms**:
  - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Guarantees the shortest path
  - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Explores paths deeply, may not find shortest path
  
- **Interactive Maze Input**:
  - Load mazes from text files
  - Create custom mazes with user-defined dimensions
  - Specify custom start and end positions
  
- **Visual Step-by-Step Solving**:
  - Watch the algorithm explore the maze in real-time
  - Clear visualization with legend
  - Path marking and current position tracking

- **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - Extensible architecture for adding new algorithms
  - Modular code structure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++11/C++17
- **Data Structures**: 
  - Vectors (2D grid representation)
  - Queue (for BFS)
  - Stack (for DFS)
  - Map (for parent tracking and visited nodes)
  - Pair (for coordinates)
- **Algorithms**: BFS, DFS
- **Design Patterns**: Strategy Pattern (Solver interface)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- C++ compiler with C++11 support or higher (g++, clang++, MSVC)
- Windows/Linux/macOS operating system

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Compilation

'''bash
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp Maze.cpp BFSolver.cpp DFSolver.cpp -o MazeSolver

### Running A program
./MazeSolver          # Linux/macOS
MazeSolver.exe        # Windows


📝 Maze File Format
Create a text file (e.g., maze.txt) with the following format:

5 5
.....
.#.#.
.#...
..##.
#....
0 0
4 4
Format Explanation:

  -> Line 1: rows columns (dimensions of the maze)
  -> Next rows lines: Maze layout
      ~  . = Open path
      ~  # = Wall/Obstacle
  -> Last 2 lines: Start position (row col) and End position (row col)

🎮 Usage
Main Menu Options

1. Use default maze: Load and solve the maze from maze.txt
2. Enter custom maze: Create your own maze interactively
3. Exit: Close the program

Solver Options

1. Solve with DFS: Use Depth-First Search algorithm
2. Solve with BFS: Use Breadth-First Search algorithm
3. Back to main menu: Return to main menu

Legend
During visualization, the following symbols are used:

Symbol	    Meaning
S	          Start Position
E	          End/Goal Position
*	          Current Position (being explored)
o	          Path Taken
#	          Wall/Obstacle
.	          Empty/Open Space


📊 Algorithm Comparison
Feature	              BFS	                               DFS
Path Quality	      Shortest path guaranteed	        May not find shortest path

Memory Usage	        Higher (stores all nodes           Lower (stores only 
                      at current level)	                 current path)

Exploration Pattern   Level-by-level (breadth-first)     Deep exploration (depth-first)

Time Complexity	      O(V + E)	                         O(V + E)

Space Complexity	    O(V)	                             O(h) where h is max depth

Creating Custom Mazes
You can create your own maze files following the format:

<rows> <cols>
<maze_layout>
<start_row> <start_col>
<end_row> <end_col>



🐛 Troubleshooting
Issue: Compilation errors

Solution: Ensure you're using C++11 or higher: g++ -std=c++11 ...
Issue: "Cannot open file" error

Solution: Make sure maze.txt is in the same directory as the executable
Issue: "No path found"

Solution: Verify that your maze has a valid path from start to end
Issue: Visualization too fast/slow

Solution: Adjust the Sleep() value in 
Maze.cpp
 (default is 200ms)
